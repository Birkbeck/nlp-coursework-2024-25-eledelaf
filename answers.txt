When is the Flesch Kincaid score NOT a valid, robust or reliable estimator of text difficultu?
Give two conditions.
Answer:
The Flesch Kincaid is a score of readability that show how difficult a text in English is to understan .
But it could fail:
    1. When the text does not have a typical sentence structure like poetry 
    2. Assuming that longer words and sentences is equal to more difficult text its not always true.

Explain your tokenizer function and discuss it performance.
Answer:
    In my tokenazer we skip the punctuations, stopword and numbers, after that we do a lemmatization of the text.
    So far, the first thig i notice is that it takes a long time to run. 
    Also looking into the classification, we can see that my tokenizer does not performn better than other two used before in the code.
